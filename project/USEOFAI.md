# Use of AI
The main and only AI model used in our project was ChatGPT.

### Use in Shaders
This was where AI was used the most. It helped us:
 - Create natural-looking fire undulation in the fire shaders.
 - Set up terrain shaders, specifically for implementing the masking system.
 - Understand how to convert the texture switching and light blinking logic we previously had into an "animation" using shaders (which were implemented by us).

### Use in Fire creation
 - Use Ai to generate the fire object's vertex structure to be used in the shaders.

### Use in Helicopter and Lake Creation
 - AI was used to design a natural and randomized shape for the lake and to calculate the areas where the helicopter could collect water.

### Use in Building Creation
 - We used AI to help implement a method for preventing the rendering of the building's hidden sides.

### Use in Forest Creation
 - AI was used to introduce randomness and to calculate fire positions in the forest—mainly for time efficiency.

### Use in Water Dropping
 - The visual effect of falling water was generated with the help of AI. The logic for triggering the water drop was written manually, but AI assisted in making the water drops look visually appealing.
